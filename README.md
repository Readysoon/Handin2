This is the README File for my planets website.

It includes some basic html sites for the first planets of the solar system.

The main page displays a list with links of them, while the subpages display a picture and some basic basic information about them. 

The while site is a Flask application and uses jinja2. 

The earth site is a dynamic page which changes based on the URL.
